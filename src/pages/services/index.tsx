The situation is                                            worse in Bihar with only 7% women having land rights, though women play an important role in various                                            agricultural activities.<br/>                                            While seeds are sown and harvesting is carried, women farmers work for about 3,300 hours which is                                            almost double that of male farmers who contribute 1,860 hours, as per a report by a leading                                            international group. Women comprise the most of small and marginal farmers. Despite their                                            contribution being high over male counterparts, their access to the market is low. They are either paid                                            less or unpaid as they do not own much land.                                        </p>                                    </div>                                    {/*{!isMobile && (*/}                                    <div className="rounded-3 col-md-6 d-flex justify-content-center align-items-center">                                        <img                                            src="/assets/farmer-women.jpg"                                            height="90%"                                            width="100%"                                            alt="logo"                                        />                                    </div>                                    {/*)}*/}                                </div>                            </div>                        </div>                    </div>                    <div className="col-12">                        <div className="container-fluid mt-5 ab">                            <div className="container">                                <div className="row">                                    <div className="rounded-3 col-md-6 d-flex justify-content-center align-items-center">                                        <img                                            src="/assets/agritech.jpg"                                            height="90%"                                            width="100%"                                            alt="logo"                                        />                                    </div>                                    <div className="col-md-6">                                        <h3 className="about" style={{fontFamily: "fantasy"}}>Agriculture and Tech</h3>                                        <p className="" style={{textAlign: "justify", fontWeight: '400'}}>                                            Automate agriculture processes for operational consistency,                                            precision, and context.                                            Our vision AI platform enables livestock and crop producers and processors to quickly and easily                                            increase efficiency, improve decision making, and realize more revenue.
