The                                    pollution may come from a variety of sources, ranging from point source water                                    pollution (from a single discharge point) to more diffuse, landscape-level causes,                                    also                                    known as non-point source pollution and air pollution. Once in the environment                                    these pollutants can have both direct effects in surrounding ecosystems, i.e.                                    killing                                    local wildlife or contaminating drinking water, and downstream effects such as dead                                    zones caused by agricultural runoff is concentrated in large water bodies.                                    <h3 className='my-3 text-decoration-underline'>Five Causes of Agricultural Pollution</h3>                                    <strong>1. Pesticides and fertilizers –</strong> Modern inputs such as pesticides and fertilizers                                    have                                    undoubtedly transformed agriculture by minimizing crop damage and boosting                                    yields, albeit temporarily. Agricultural pollution has many different sources.                                    Nitrogen-based fertilizers produce potent greenhouse gases and can overload                                    waterways with dangerous pollutants; chemical pesticides with varying toxicological                                    effects can contaminate our air and water or reside directly on our food. <br/><br/>                                        <strong>2. Contaminated water –</strong> Contaminated water used for irrigation is one further                                    source of agricultural pollution. Water pollution is the contamination of water                                    bodies, usually as a result of human activities, so that it negatively affects its                                    uses.                                    Water bodies include lakes, rivers, oceans, aquifers, reservoirs and groundwater.                                    Water pollution results when contaminants are introduced into these water bodies.<br/><br/>                                        <strong>3. Soil erosion and sedimentation –</strong> Soil is comprised of many layers, with the                                    topmost serving to support farming and grazing. Erosion is the transport by wind,                                    water and ice of soil, sediment and rock fragments produced by the weathering of                                    geological features. Sedimentation occurs when eroded material that is being                                    transported by water, settles out of the water column onto the surface, as the water                                    flow slows.<br/><br/>                                        <strong>4. Livestock –</strong> Manure from livestock such as cattle, sheep, pigs, and chickens also                                    contributes to both air pollution and water pollution. Livestock and manure                                    management are also major contributors to greenhouse gas releases.<strong> Emissions of                                    methane from ruminants digesting fibrous feeds and from manure storage                                    facilities</strong> add up to nearly 90 million tons per year, accounting for about 16                                    percent                                    of global annual production.<br/><br/>                                        <strong>5. Pests and weeds –</strong> The introduction of non-native crops to new geographies through                                    agricultural                                    production systems often causes problems for local ecosystems. Pest is defined as a                                    living organism,                                    either a plant, fungus, or animal that is harmful to humans, human concerns, crops,                                    and livestock                                    and threatens their existence. Weed, on the other hand, is a plant that grows where                                    it is not needed                                    when it's not needed.                                    <h3 className='my-3 text-decoration-underline'>What Are the Effects of Agricultural Pollution on the                                    Environment?</h3>                                        <h5>Reduction and alteration of wildlife habitats.</h5>                                    Agricultural pollution can pose risks to ecosystems and thus important ecosystem                                    services. Certain pesticides, for example, can harm a wide range of ecologically and                                    economically important organisms, including pollinators, natural predators, birds,                                    and                                    microbial communities. For example, 35% of all food production relies on                                    pollinators,                                    which can be negatively impacted by direct contact with pesticides, as well as                                    residues                                    left on plants.<br/><br/>                                    <h5>Introduction of toxic chemicals, nutrients, and pathogens.</h5>                                    As mentioned above, a number of agricultural inputs such as pesticides and                                    fertilizers                                    — not to mention antibiotics from animal production — make their way into drinking                                    water, which can impact human health. Many of these pollutants are known                                    carcinogens and are notoriously difficult to remove from tap water. From China to                                    the United States, drinking water in many regions of the world is no longer potable                                    due to agricultural pollution.<br/><br/>                                    <h5>Invasive species</h5>                                    Invasive species introduced through agriculture can harm local vegetation and                                    wildlife,                                    altering ecosystems permanently. In some cases, when native species cannot adapt to                                    novel diseases or introduced pests, or cannot compete with a new species that lack                                    natural predators, they can face extinction – as was the case with the American                                    chestnut, which was nearly wiped out due to a disease introduced by the Chinese                                    chestnut.<br/><br/>                                    <h5>Changes in the hydrologic cycle</h5>                                    Water pollution from agriculture can be intensified as a result of practices such as                                    drainage tiling. Although tiling a farm field increases productivity,                                    faster-draining fields                                    reduce filtration, allowing larger amounts of fertilizers and pesticides to enter                                    waterways and in turn worsening problems like eutrophication.<br/><br/>                                    <h5>Climate change</h5>                                    Among the largest and most complex problems facing our world today, climate                                    change includes not only global warming but also more frequent extreme weather                                    events and shifting dynamics of diseases and pests — all of which affect agriculture                                    profoundly. Agriculture itself is a large contributor to greenhouse gas emissions,                                    which                                    worsen climate change by accumulating in the atmosphere and trapping heat.<br/><br/>                                    <h5>How Much Pollution Is Caused by Farming?</h5>                                    Although estimates vary, the US EPA reports that agriculture accounts for 24% of                                    global greenhouse gas emissions, with animal agriculture representing 14.5 percent                                    of GHG emissions. Additionally, agriculture is responsible for up to 78% of                                    freshwater eutrophication and threatens 24,000 species with extinction due to                                    pollution and habitat destruction.<br/><br/>                                    <h3 className='my-3 text-decoration-underline'>How Can Farmers Reduce Their Environmental                                    Impact?</h3>                                    There are a number of land management strategies farmers can adopt to reduce                                    their environmental impact, improve air quality and water quality, and benefit                                    ecosystems and public health.<br/><br/>                                    <h5>Cover Crops and Conservation Tillage</h5>                                    To reduce soil erosion on their fields, many farmers employ a strategy of                                    conservation                                    tillage, which refers to any tillage regime that leaves 30% of the soil surface                                    covered                                    with residue.

Cold                                    season cover crops such as oats, vetch, and rye, as well as warm-season cover crops                                    like sorghum-sudangrass and cowpeas, are planted during fallow periods so as to                                    maintain ground cover, limit runoff, build soil organic matter, scavenge nutrients,                                    and                                    feed the soil microbiome.

When applied to cropland in proper quantities                                    at                                    the correct time, manure can serve as an important source of organic matter and                                    fertility, containing important nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. In some                                    areas, regional governments have begun adopting manure management policies                                    and incentive programs to reduce nutrient loads on farms and protect important                                    watersheds, with many regions like the Chesapeake Bay setting nutrient load limits                                    for cropland.<br/><br/>                                    <h5 className='my-3 text-decoration-underline'>Using AGRARIAN to Combat Agricultural Pollution and Solutions.</h5>                                    Digital agricultural solutions such as AGRARIAN are another important tool in                                    improving both the productivity and sustainability of farms. Farm Management                                    Software like AGRARIAN allows farmers to not only track how much fertilizer and                                    pesticides they apply, aggregating this data into readable reports for compliance,                                    record keeping, and data analysis purposes, but also create prescription maps that                                    adjust fertilizer and pesticide application rates based on real-time data about crop                                    productivity, soil fertility, and plant health. Weather and pest alarms further                                    allow                                    farmers to time their spraying activities thus reducing costs incurred by repeating                                    tasks                                    unnecessarily. Using AGRARIAN farms can take preventative actions to reduce pests,                                    disease, and abiotic disorders before they become a problem in the first place.<br/><br/><br/><br/>                                        <p>This Article is Contributed by</p>                                        Name:- Ashutosh Kumar                                        Founder-Cum-CEO                                    </p>                                </div>                            </div>                        </div>                    </div>                </div>            </div>        </>    )}export default Blog;
