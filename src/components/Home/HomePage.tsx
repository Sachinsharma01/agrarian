          The Ek Soch Foundation was established in the year 2011, with the
          objective
          of empowering entrepreneurs working at the grass-root level, in the
          fields of agriculture, micro-entrepreneurship, sanitation,
          health and education.

          After supporting several initiatives and running multiple programs in
          the holy city of Varanasi and five districts around it, we moved
          our area of focus to the
          Mathura – Vrindavan region, in Uttar Pradesh, which is India’s most
          populous
          state with over 200 million people. It is rich in art and culture, as
          well as tenders fertile soil as a result of the Ganga and the
          Yamuna doab.
