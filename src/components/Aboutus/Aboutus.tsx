                <p className="aboutus2">
                    The Ek Soch Foundation was established in the year 2011, with the objective of<br/> empowering
                    entrepreneurs working at the grass-root level, in the fields of
                    agriculture,<br/> micro-entrepreneurship, sanitation, health and education.<br/>
                        After supporting several initiatives and running multiple programs in the holy city
                        of<br/> Varanasi and five districts around it, we moved our area of focus to the Mathura
                        –<br/> Vrindavan region, in Uttar Pradesh, which is India’s most populous state with over
                            200<br/> million people. It is rich in art and culture, as well as tenders fertile soil as a
                                result of<br/> the Ganga and the Yamuna doab.<br/>
                                    Since livelihood and health are intrinsically linked, we have made it our focus to
                                    create sustainable and long term income opportunities that will eventually help
                                    improve overall health conditions as well. Agriculture and Micro businesses form the
                                    core of rural India and are in fact, the backbone of the entire nation.<br/>
                                        Organic farming has the potential to reduce the input cost of farmers, along
                                        with safeguarding soil fertility. Community-based social entrepreneurship,
                                        enabled by technology, can create affordable, scalable solutions to local
                                        problems. At Ek Soch Foundation, we believe that every idea, every step, and
                                            every individual, can help to make a difference.
